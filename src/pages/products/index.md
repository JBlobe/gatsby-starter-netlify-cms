description: The control unit B.BOX Professional will impress you with its
  exceptionally sleek design and well-conceived ergonomics. The large, clearly
  arranged touch screen display is easy to operate and lets you control up to
  two application devices simultaneously and independently of each other (2-in-1
  function). The award-winning touch screen display allows for easy, intuitive
  operation of the device. The display is very clearly structured and
  self-explanatory. It also features Edit Mode, a software tool that allows you
  to create your own indication-specific programs and store them in up to nine
  memory locations.
